# Hi, I'm Monica and I'm looking for a job! 👋🏻

In 2020, I earned my master's degree in data analytics. I'm looking for a role where I can leverage my **social science training** and **data interpretation skills** to add value to a company I believe in. I consider myself lifelong learner and a generalist, but some of my special interests are statistics, methodology, and social good. I'm eager to bring my breadth of experience to making sense of data, no matter how messy.
 
 
 ## I'm all about...
 * Python
 * R
 * SQL
 * data visualization
 * machine learning
 
 ## I'd like to spend more time with...
 * APIs
 * testing
 * interactive visualizations
 
 ## Let's talk!
